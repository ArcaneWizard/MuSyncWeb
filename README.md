## Purpose
MuSync takes the difficult task of syncing recordings and streamlines it to create a perfect output track, allowing musicians to co-create no matter where they are in the world. A conductor can create a lobby for anyone to join.

## Setup to configure repo:
- run `npm start` in the client directory and `nodemon index.js` in the server directory

Create a .env file in the base folder. Add your MongoDB Atlas URL to connect to your own MongoDB database

```
MONGOATLAS_URL = [Insert link here]
```

## Note
Website is down since Heroku disabled support for free hosting. Will redeploy website in a day or two, sorry for the inconvenience
